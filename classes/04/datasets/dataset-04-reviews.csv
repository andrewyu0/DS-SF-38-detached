2017-07-24,RWUORD2ZGTTMA,Jim Smith,Flexible and scratch-free!,"I do a lot of gardening and weight lifting.  Both are activities that scratch the heck out of my rings.  I'd developed a habit of simply not wearing my wedding band when working out or working outside, but it did not feel like the best solution.  I've got a couple silicone wrist bands I've worn for many years, so decided to give these a try.  Have had them a couple weeks, and I love them!  First, the bands are very flexible -- I got them sized for my left hand, but they even slide onto my right hand for accent.  Second, they have worked well in the dirt, and seem impervious to scratching from weights or tools. Third, having them in four colors is just FUN!",5
